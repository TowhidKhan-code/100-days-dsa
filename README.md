# 100 Days DSA Challenge 🚀

## Who am I?
Recently graduated BSc IT student, starting from complete scratch.
No prior Java or DSA experience. Documenting every single day honestly.

## Goal
Become a job-ready Software Developer in 100 days through
consistent daily practice — no shortcuts, no skipping days.

## Resources I'm Using
- Kunal Kushwaha's Java + DSA playlist (YouTube)
- LeetCode for daily problem solving practice
- Striver's DSA sheet for supplementing gaps
- Pramp for mock interviews (starting day 81)

## Topics Roadmap
| Phase | Topics | Days | Status |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Java Fundamentals + OOP | 1 - 20 | 🔄 In Progress |
| Phase 2 | Arrays, Recursion, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search | 21 - 40 | ⏳ |
| Phase 3 | Trees, Heaps, Graphs, Dynamic Programming | 41 - 65 | ⏳ |
| Phase 4 | Interview Prep + Mock Interviews + Java Internals | 66 - 80 | ⏳ |
| Phase 5 | Applying + Communication + Networking | 81 - 100 | ⏳ |

## Concepts Covered
- Java Fundamentals — variables, data types, operators
- Type casting and type promotion
- Scanner input with buffer flush fix
- Conditionals — if/else, switch with fall-through
- Loops — for, while, do-while, break, continue
- Methods — definition, return types, parameters
- Pass by Value — why primitives and Strings dont change
- String immutability
- Scope — method, block, loop
- Variable shadowing
- VarArgs
- Method overloading — compile time polymorphism
- Arrays — fixed size, contiguous memory, O(1) access
- null in Java — NullPointerException
- String arrays
- for-each loop
- Arrays.toString() and deepToString()
- Array of objects — reference storage in Heap
- Array passing in functions — why original changes
- 2D arrays and jagged arrays
- ArrayList — dynamic resizing, autoboxing
- Built-in Array functions — sort, search, fill, copy
- Linear search — basic, string, 2D, all occurrences
- Binary search — iterative, first/last occurrence, count occurrences
- Safe mid formula — low + (high - low) / 2
