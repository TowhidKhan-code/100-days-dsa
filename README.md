# 100 Days DSA Challenge 🚀

## Who am I?
Recently graduated BSc IT student, starting from complete scratch.
No prior Java or DSA experience. Documenting every single day honestly.

## Goal
Become a job-ready Software Developer in 100 days through
consistent daily practice — no shortcuts, no skipping days.

## Resources I'm Using
- Kunal Kushwaha's Java + DSA playlist (YouTube)
- LeetCode for daily problem solving practice
- Striver's DSA sheet for supplementing gaps
- Pramp for mock interviews (starting day 81)
